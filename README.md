# Java 20 Day Challenge ðŸš€

Welcome to my Java 20-Day Challenge! 
For the next 20 days, I will be dedicating time each day to improve my Java programming skills and dive deeper into different data structures and algorithms. 
This repository contains all the code and notes I created during this challenge.

## Overview

I am taking on this 20-day challenge to enhance my understanding of fundamental data structures and algorithms using Java. 
Each day, I will focus on a specific topic and implement related code to reinforce my learning. This README will be updated daily to reflect my progress.

## Daily Progress

### Day 1 - Array & ArrayList
- **Topics Covered:**
  - Basics of Arrays
  - Introduction to ArrayLists
  - Differences between Arrays and ArrayLists
- **Code:**
  - [Array](https://github.com/Jabiullah/Java-20-Days-Challenge/tree/master/src/array_week_1)
- **Summary:**
  - Explored the fundamental differences between arrays and arraylists in Java.
  - Practised basic operations like adding, removing, and accessing elements.

### Day 2 & 3- Linked List
- **Topics Covered:**
  - Singly Linked List
  - Basic Operations (add, remove, traverse)
  - Linked List Palindrome - Important for placement
- **Code:**
  - [Linked List Implementation](https://github.com/Jabiullah/Java-20-Days-Challenge/tree/master/src/linked_list_week_1)
- **Summary:**
  - Implemented a basic singly linked list from scratch, understanding how nodes are linked together and practising operations such as insertion and deletion.
  - Implemented a solution that involves reversing the second half of the list and comparing it with the first half.

### Day 4 - Stack
- **Topics Covered:**
  - Stack Data Structure
  - Implementation using ArrayList and Linked List
- **Code:**
  - [Stack Implementation](https://github.com/Jabiullah/Java-20-Days-Challenge/tree/master/src/stack_and_queue)
- **Summary:**
  - Learned about the Stack data structure and its operations. Implemented Stack using both ArrayList and Linked lists.
    
### Day 5 - Queue Basic
- **Topics Covered:**
  - Queue Data Structure with (Queue and Linked List) library.
  - Comparison with Stack and Queue. 
- **Code:**
  - [Queue Implementation](https://github.com/Jabiullah/Java-20-Day-Challenge/blob/master/src/stack_and_queue_week_2/queue_basic.java)
- **Summary:**
  - Learned about the Queue data structure and its operations.
